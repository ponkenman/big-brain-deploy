UI
- grids for games/questions/answers to make more organised
- consistent font throughout
- consistent colour scheme of pink and white with tertiary colours for actions eg red = delete, green = start
- visual hierarchy (titles near top and content below, bigger = more important)
- icon affordances making interactions obvious eg edit pencil icon, delete icon, labelled buttons, underlined anchors to switch between forms in login/register
- consistency between screens eg always a back to previous screen button, navbar

UX
- alerts provide immediate feedback, coloured red/green, auto dismissed, and deleting one deletes all
- warnings given on forms for validation
- modals used instead of jumping to new pages to streamline productivity
- allowing question to be created all at once rather than going to other page for it
- using familiar and common design patterns
- instructions where necessary eg minigames, points
- minimalist information and icons rather than merely words so user not overloaded
