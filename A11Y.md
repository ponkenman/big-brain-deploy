Perceivability 
- descriptive alt tags for all images used
- all text is distinguishable on background (no difficult to see or non-contrastic colours eg white text on dark backgrounds)

Operability
- all keyboard interactions supported
- no keyboard traps
- headers, sections, other structural sematic html tags used eg article for game cards
- aria labels for icon-only buttons
- aria modal and dialong for dialog modals
- no flashing content very quickly
- error messages auto dismissed after irrelevant (4 seconds) and have alert role

Understandability
- HTML in English
- All hyperlinks/buttons have relevant labels
- All inputs in forms labelled with for and id

Robustness
- All HTML is parseable (eg different levels of heading tags, using semantic HTML, not using outdated tags)
- Using buttons and anchors appropriately (buttons for actions, while anchors for switching between pages)
